# Offline2On House Style for Generic Text

**Foundation Style: [The Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/frontmatter/toc.html)**

*Note: Brand names and legal names are excluded from the Offline2On house
style.  For example, the correct spelling of AT&T is AT&T â€” not because of
Offline2On's rules about ampersands, but because it's a brand name.*

# Supplements and Overrides
## Grammar
### Commas
Serial commas are used.
> Go to the store and get eggs, cheese, and COVID-19.

## Headings
### Casing
All headings and subheadings are written in title case.

### Length
All headings and subheadings are no more than eight words long.
> If Your Heading is This Long, You Should Consider Rewording It

### Punctuation
Headings and subheadings never end with a period, even if they happen to sound
like a real sentence.

## Lists
### Numbered Headings
Numbered headings are formatted with a period, and the number is always written with a numeral.  Example:
> #### 1. Thing Number One
> #### 2. Thing Number Two

### Punctuation
In lists, the text block of a list item never ends with a period, unless the
text block contains multiple sentences.

## Typography
### Ampersands and "and"
Use an ampersand character (`&`) in abbreviated text, such as R&D or Q&A.

Write out the word "and" in unabbreviated text, such as *"custom development
and support"* or *"shipping and logistics"*.

### Numbers
Single-digit numbers are always written out: "five", not "5".

Multi-digit numbers, or numbers with punctuation such as a decimal or a dollar sign, are always written with digits.

### Spaces Between Sentences
Adjacent sentences in a paragraph are separated by exactly one space character.

## Spelling
### B
brick-and-mortar

business owner *(correct replacement of ~merchant~)*

### E
e-commerce

email

### M
~merchant~ ***DEPRECATED*** See "business owner"

### O
Offline2On
> Display name (en-US): Offline2On
>
> Hostname: `Offline2On.com`
>
> Full URLs to Offline2On, in particular user-visible instances, should prefer
> `Offline2On.com` as the hostname.  When technologically awkward or
> unavoidable, `offline2on.com` is acceptable.  All other casings, such as
> `Offline2on.com` and `offline2On.com`, should never be used.
