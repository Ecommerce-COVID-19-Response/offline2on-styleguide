## Headings
### Casing
All headings and subheadings are written in title case.

### Length

### Punctuation
Headings and subheadings never end with a period, even if they happen to sound
like a real sentence.

## Lists
### Punctuation
In lists, the text block of a list item never ends with a period, unless the
text block contains multiple sentences.

## Typography
### Spaces between sentences
Adjacent sentences in a paragraph are separated by exactly one space character.

## Spelling
### B
business owner *(correct replacement of ~merchant~)*

### E

### O
Offline2On
> Display name (en-US): Offline2On
>
> Hostname: `Offline2On.com`
>
> Full URLs to Offline2On, in particular user-visible instances, should prefer
> `Offline2On.com` as the hostname.  When technologically awkward or
> unavoidable, `offline2on.com` is acceptable.  All other casings, such as
> `Offline2on.com` and `offline2On.com`, should never be used.
